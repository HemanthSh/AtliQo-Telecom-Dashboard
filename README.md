# **Telecom Data Analysis: Evaluating the Impact of 5G on AtliQo**

Welcome to the Telecom Data Analysis project! This repository contains a detailed analysis of AtliQo's telecom data using Power BI Desktop and Excel. Our primary focus is on comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) before and after the launch of 5G in May 2022. The insights gained from this analysis aim to help AtliQo optimize its internet plans and recover its active user base.

## **Project Description**

### **About AtliQo**
AtliQo is one of India's leading telecom providers, recognized for its innovative services and widespread coverage. In May 2022, AtliQo, along with other telecom providers, launched its 5G plans, marking a significant milestone in its service offerings. However, post-launch, the company observed a decline in both active users and revenue growth. Concerned about these trends, AtliQo's management tasked their analytics team with delivering a comparative analysis of KPIs between the pre- and post-5G launch periods. The goal is to derive actionable insights that could guide the company in regaining its market position and enhancing user engagement.

This project was undertaken as part of the November Codebasics Resume Project Challenge.
